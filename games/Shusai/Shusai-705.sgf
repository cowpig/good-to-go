C[(HS) A special ploy. ]
(;B[dj]
C[(HS) Black `a' is also good. ]
;W[di];B[ej];W[ei];B[fj];W[fi];B[kc]
C[(GSG) Intended to make Black `a' effective. ]
;W[mc];B[ke]
C[(GSG) The shoulder hit at `a' is also possible. ]
;W[me];B[gi];W[gh];B[hh];W[gg];B[gc]
C[(GSG) `a' is more normal but no matter how the variations go after this contact play there will be room enough to live in the corner. ]

C[(HS) `a' was better. ]
;B[he];W[kb];B[ff];W[fo];B[dn];W[fq];B[eq];W[er];B[dr];W[gr]
;B[kq];W[qn];B[rd]
C[(HS) Should be at `a'.  (GSG) Should be `b'. ]

;W[cm];B[dg];W[cf];B[cg];W[eg]
C[(HS) A shallow idea. `a' is the place to defend. ]
;B[bg];W[fg];B[ed];W[bh];B[bj]
C[(HS) A forcing move - one reason why \\t was bad. Others are that Black can squeeze at `a' at some future point, and can make good endgame plays against the corner. ]
;W[ag];B[bm];W[ds]
C[(HS) White `a' would have killed off the black stone \\t. ]
;B[cs];W[es];B[cr];W[ep];B[dq];W[kn]
C[(HS) Despite a lot of effort I could not find the right spot. ]
;B[gs];W[hs];B[nr];W[or]
C[(HS) Perhaps patiently defending at `a' was better. ]
;B[mq];W[np];B[lr];W[ns];B[hr];W[fs];B[is];W[iq];B[hq];W[ip]
;B[gs];W[fr];B[mr]
C[(GSG) I did not have enough confidence to fight the ko at `a'. ]
;W[pq]
C[(GSG) It was rather mortifying to have to let White play 101. But at least Black clearly lives with his next two moves. ]
;B[jr];W[lp];B[ks];W[ir];B[ms];W[hs];B[af];W[ah];B[gs];W[pb]
C[(GSG) I felt overcome by White 111. Looking back, I was less than circumspect in playing \\t. I should have played at `a'. ]
;B[nd];W[md];B[ob];W[oc];B[pc];W[nb];B[qg]
C[(GSG) Should have been more restrained, at`a'. The move played gives White room to play `a' then `b', as he did on move 131. ]

;W[fm];B[jd];W[ic];B[hp];W[hn];B[ok]
C[(GSG) If neglected a White play in this area becomes too good. There is no option but to abandon \\t. ]
;W[oi];B[bi]
C[(GSG) This should really have been played earlier, before cutting at \\t. Then assuming White answers in the same way as in the game, at `a', Black can try `b' in sente, with the possibility of being able to omit the cut \\t. In other words, 146 is less effective now than it could have been then.  Shusai agreed. ]
;W[ch];B[hg];W[hf]
C[(HS) There is nothing further worth commenting on. ]

C[(HS) The outcome is now decided. ]
