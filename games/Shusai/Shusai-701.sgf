C[Better to take advantage of the ladder breaker \\t with `a'. ]
;W[df];B[dg];W[ef];B[gf];W[eg](;B[di]
C[Again not the optimum move, which is `a'. ]
;W[he];B[ff];W[cf](;B[cb]
C[`a' is better.  Why is this slack? White's next move may surprise you. ]
;W[ci]
C[A typical Shusai move. ]
(;B[dh]
C[Black has a difficult game already. She probably dug in her heels with 20 to justify her last move \\t, but blocking at `a' may have been easier. ]
;W[dj];B[ej];W[dk];B[fh]
C[This at least gives Black some cause for satisfaction. ]
;W[bb];B[ek];W[dm](;B[dl]
C[Simply extending to `a' is better. ]
;W[cl];B[el];W[cn];B[ig];W[fq](;B[eo]
C[The first really questionable move. Black should probe White's intentions with `a'. ]
;W[em];B[gp];W[gm]
C[Allowing White to get these two moves is why 34 was bad. ]
(;B[gq]
C[Black still has the opportunity to play `a' - she should take it. ]
;W[fg];B[gg];W[gh]
C[But this way it is White who gets some action in the centre, not to mention the initiative. ]
;B[fi];W[hh];B[ii];W[gj];B[hj]
C[Black overlooked White's next move. Would you? ]
(;W[ij]
C[!!  The predictable move at `a' fails. ]
;B[bh]
C[Too late now. ]
;W[bj];B[bf];W[be];B[gi];W[hi];B[hk];W[ih];B[jh];W[ji];B[hg]
;W[ii];B[kh]
C[Shusai said this was very bad. It has to be at `a' to keep \\t in check. ]
;W[gk]
C[This leads to a big ko. ]
;B[bc];W[af](;B[ag]
C[Inevitable, as `a' loses. ]

;W[ab];B[ac];W[bg];B[ck];W[cj];B[bf];W[db];B[aa];W[bg](;B[eb]
C[Black is the first to blink, but it is not clear why. She should have continued the ko with `a'. ]
;W[ah]
C[A big loss for Black, but not fatal in a 3-stone game. ]
;B[lj];W[kk](;B[lk]
C[Better at `a'. ]
;W[kl];B[lc];W[ll](;B[nk]
C[Should attack at `a'. ]
;W[ld]
C[Punishes Black for her slack play. Note that the big Black \\t group only has one eye.  Shusai said that once White lived here, Black had no hope of winning. Sugiuchi was not so sure. ]

C[Here we can seen why Sugiuchi thought the game was close. Had White connected at `a', as expected, there is not much in it. So White resorts to an overplay. ]

C[Very big. ]

C[Not the best. Compare `a'. ]

C[Good move. ]
