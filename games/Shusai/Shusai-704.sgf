C[I think 4 is bigger than `a'. (GS) ]
;W[ch];B[dn];W[jc];B[mc];W[jq];B[qj];W[me];B[jd]
C[To play at `a' means being forced, and to play at `b' gives White the right momentum to play `c'. (GS) ]
;W[kc]
C[`a' is bad because of the ladder after Black 13.. (HS) ]
;B[kd];W[lc];B[ld];W[md];B[nc];W[id]
C[`a' is another possibility. (HS) ]
;B[kf];W[hd]
C[`a' is correct, to avoid giving Black his next two forcing moves. (HS) ]

C[If `a' instead... ]
;B[mq]
C[One step further at `a' was better. (GS) ]
;W[gq];B[ej]
C[It was better to defend the corner at `a'. (GS) ]
;W[qp];B[qo];W[po];B[op]
C[There are various possibilities here but I was confident White could not live in the corner. (GS) ]

C[It was a regrettable slip not to have exchanged `a' for Black `b' before playing this. (HS) ]
;B[pn]
C[This negates the previously mentioned forcing move at `a'. ]
;W[or];B[nr];W[nq];B[np]
C[Cutting at `a' was also possible. (HS) ]

;W[lq];B[kq];W[kp];B[lr];W[pq];B[nn];W[lo];B[iq]
C[`a' is also a safe alternative, as White's corner group can be captured. (GS) ]
;W[lq];B[kr];W[dk]
C[Aims at pushing through at `a'. But it did not work out as expected. The oversight of not playing at `b' earlier was decisive. (HS) ]

C[Better not to rush ahead with this but to play at `a' to defend the corner. (GS) ]
