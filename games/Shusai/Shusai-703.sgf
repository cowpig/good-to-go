C[Either `a' or `b' is also possible. (GS) ]

C[The usual invasion at `a' is more suited to this position. (HS) ]
;B[qc];W[nc];B[nd];W[oc];B[od];W[mb];B[lc];W[qb]
C[This should be at `a'. Shusai expected 61 to be a forcing move, with Black answering at `b', and then he would have played at `a', but he was being greedy. ]

C[Black would like to play `a' but then White can cause complications. (GS) ]

C[Slack. Should be at `a', which gives White reasonable prospects. (HS) ]

C[The correct order was to exchange White `a' for Black `b' first. (HS) ]
;B[jd];W[hc];B[bd];W[ce];B[hb];W[hd];B[je]
C[The wrong way - extension to `a' was better. (GS) ]
;W[ib];B[jc];W[gb];B[be];W[bc];B[bf];W[cf];B[ag];W[ij];B[fm]
C[White now pays for not having made the a-b exchange, which prevents the cut, and Black moves into a clear territorial lead. (HS)  Had the a-b exchange been played, Black would now play not 22 but `c', White `d', Black `e'. It was good to be able to play 22. (GS) ]

C[Perhaps `a' was better. (GS). ]
