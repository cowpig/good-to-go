C[White 22 cannot be at "a". ]

C[Black cannot play at "a". ]

C[Black 33 is strong. This induces White to play at 34. This should not be at "a". ]
;W[cd];B[bc]
C[And this lets Black make his group in the corner safe with 35. ]

C[Black 33 also allows Black to press White with 37 and the following moves. ]

C["His play 47 shocked everyone. Kawabata said 'I was really startled at the instant when Black played 47. White's move 48 (A) is so good. Black pressed White on the third line with a thick and heavy wall. The Great Wall of Kitani was his life work. He refused to fall into any trap.'" ]
;W[jp]
C[White 48 is the absolute move. Shusai said 'It is the ideal play of Black, but he seems to have over-estimated the thickness of the outside wall.' So both Shusai and Kitani were satisfied with their moves 47 and 48. ]

C[If Black plays elsewhere, (transcriber's suggestion).. ]

C[Black 7 forces White 8 and accordingly, Black 9 and 11, which make the corner group perfectly alive. ]

C[In the sequence from 15 White "pays his utmost effort to get ahead of Black, especially White 20". ]
(;B[hd]
C[Good timing. If neglected, for "a" (transcriber's suggestion).. (Extract from Kawabata, The Master of Go). "He leaned over the board, the chart in his hand, and looked for Black 121. He could not find it. .. Yawata should have found it immediatley, but his eyes wandered over the chart. "Ah!" he said at length. I was some slight distance from the board, and even after the Black stone had been played I had difficulty finding it. When presently I did find it, I was at a loss for an explanation. off in the upper reaches of the board, it lay apart from the fight that was coming to a climax at the centre." ]
