C[Black could play at "a" instead for Black 13.]
;W[qj]
C[White 12 forces Black to play at 13, to prevent another shimari, which then gives White the ideal extension of 14.]
(;B[gc]
C[Black 15 would now be played at "a". Karigane commented that Black should have simply extended to "c".]

C[Black 21 wouyld be better at "a".]
(;W[kc]
C[If White plays at "a"..]
;B[ql]
C[Because of the closeness of \\t, Black A is not attractive, so an invasion of White's moyo is better.]

C[White 24 is a good move. Normally, White would play at "a".]
(;B[qg]
C[Black 25 at "a" would not be recommended.]
;W[ok]
C[White 24 and 26 are characteristic moves of Shusai which show his positional judgment and flexibility.]
;B[om];W[pm];B[pl];W[ol];B[pn];W[nm];B[qm];W[nn];B[rj];W[eo]
C[White does not mind Black connecting his group on the side, since he is trying to make a grand moyo on the lower side.]

C[Black makes a deep invasion before White can completely secure his territory.]

C[Black 45 could also be played at "a".]

C[Black could also live easily with "a"..]
;W[kq];B[jr];W[lq];B[lr];W[mr];B[hq](;W[hp](;B[gp]
C[Black could live with 55 at "a"; however, Black was not worried about losing the group. He was using it as bait to try an get a squeeze on the outside.]
;W[go];B[mq];W[nr];B[fr];W[hr]
C[White decides that he is going to kill the group.]
;B[gq];W[fs];B[gs](;W[ls]
C[White 64 is the opportunity for White to test Black's reaction with "a".]
;B[hs];W[ks];B[ep];W[br];B[gr];W[js]
C[Now that White has taken the eyes away, Black uses the stones to cut at the weak points on the outside.]

C[Karigane regretted connecting at 15; he said this should be at "a".]
;W[ek](;B[mo]
C[Karigane thought that Black 17 was bad since it loses ko threats. He should have played at "a". However, Kitani and Go Seigen didn't think that 15 and 17 were particularly bad.]

C[White 20 is excellent.]

C[Black 29 is somewhat doubtful. It would be better to play at "a".]

C[White 36 is a smart move and makes the corner yose-ko.]

C[Black 45 is a calm move.]

C[White 102 is very good. This helps him to capture three White stones.]

C[Black 15 would be better at "a", "b" or "c". With each of these movbes, Black may get better ko threats, but he had too little time.]

C[Go Seigen commented that this move was rather doubtful because Black then has the large ko threat at A. Playing at "a" would be better.]
