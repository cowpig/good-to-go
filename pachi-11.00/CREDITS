	Sylvain Gelly, David Silver


Pachi contains unpublished methods we claim we have invented
independently and are preparing for publication:

* The dynamic komi feature.
* The local tree feature.


These people have made significant contributions to the code:

Petr Baudis
	Pachi the Bot ;-)

Jean-loup Gaily
	Distributed engine
	Time allocation algorithm
	Efficient UCT memory allocator


Pachi uses data extracted from the Kogo joseki dictionary as its
