;B[cn]BL[13669.876]C[uurtamo [-\]: yes, to go from 100% to 48.7% in a sequence of moves all of which could be explored, means something isn't right. :)

;B[bm]BL[13363.95]C[blob [5k\]: ....why do these bots get so much time?

]
;W[cc]WL[13039.78]C[uurtamo [-\]: isn't desirable in what sense?
blob [5k\]: is there a fast tournament?
uurtamo [-\]: have you ever tried to write a machine go program?
blob [5k\]: i've started one yes
uurtamo [-\]: there are tournaments every month, and a server where programs are continuously playing one another
blob [5k\]: by not desirable i mean that i find efficiency in computation intuitively more "human"
blob [5k\]: than monte carlo-esque stuff anyway
uurtamo [-\]: http://www.weddslist.com/kgs
blob [5k\]: thanks for that
]
;B[kq]BL[13166.445]C[uurtamo [-\]: i think that you want computation to be a certain way that it might not be.
blob [5k\]: look, the status quo is that humans are stronger than machines at go, yet use less resources (energy wise)
blob [5k\]: i think it's natural to learn by that example somehow
uurtamo [-\]: that idea was very popular in the 70's.
blob [5k\]: so?
uurtamo [-\]: i'm just suggesting that other approaches have been quite a bit more successful, not just in computer go, but machine learning in general and that you ought not discount their success.
uurtamo [-\]: there's a mistake in being fixated on what "seems natural"
uurtamo [-\]: computers aren't all that natural and neither is computation.
blob [5k\]: i am familiar with ai techniques
]
;W[ko]WL[12892.264]C[uurtamo [-\]: there's a mailing list about computer go if you're interested in seeing what people think about.

blob [5k\]: i know what's out there already.....
]
;B[hq]BL[12958.564]C[blob [5k\]: there's a huge gain to be had over mere monte carlo, by clustering and classifying patterns dynamically
uurtamo [-\]: well, the easiest way to test your ideas is on CGOS.
uurtamo [-\]: http://cgos.boardspace.net
blob [5k\]: yeah, as soon as i get some more time on my hands ):
blob [5k\]: i will :)
uurtamo [-\]: because otherwise you are simply fantasizing.
uurtamo [-\]: also, "mere monte carlo" has developed quite a bit.
blob [5k\]: i already have a working ML go prototype
uurtamo [-\]: great. you can probably hook it into cgos with very little trouble, then.
]
;W[jp]WL[12747.122]C[blob [5k\]: probably, but i want to work on it more first

blob [5k\]: btw, any existing go bots that use machine learning out there?
uurtamo [-\]: yes, and they all get crushed by the monte carlo bots. which is why everyone is studying that now.
uurtamo [-\]: just teasing.
blob [5k\]: hah
]
;W[hp]WL[12601.969]C[uurtamo [-\]: there are bots that implement some kinds of machine learning, but they usually also have a very strong monte-carlo component.
blob [5k\]: that's good news for me
uurtamo [-\]: because otherwise they get absolutely crushed.
uurtamo [-\]: but you should ask on the computer go mailing list. there are lots of helpful ideas there and people there.
blob [5k\]: they probably rely on monte carlo so much because their board evaluation sucks
blob [5k\]: and have to play out very far
uurtamo [-\]: be careful with your estimate of other programs you haven't written.
]
;B[gp]BL[12750.975]C[uurtamo [-\]: the only thing you can be sure of is what you've already written.
blob [5k\]: ok :p
blob [5k\]: have you written a bot?
uurtamo [-\]: for instance, many faces of go, which is very strong, not uses some MC, but didn't before.
uurtamo [-\]: nope, i just started writing one.
uurtamo [-\]: *now uses
uurtamo [-\]: i've written a board evaluator, but never turned it into a bot.
