PW[pachi]PB[CzechBot]BR[1k]DT[2010-12-05]GC[34 +E1:bad! pachi does not see snapback after black B2+C1. The "does not seen snapback" bug is nasty.  The problem is that there is also a "global capture heuristic" if there're no fun local moves, it looks for groups to capture and if white tenukis and does not capture immediately, this heuristic kicks in.  But there is no "global atari heuristic" that would drive black similarly to play at F1 and create the snapback if I test with playout=moggy:capturerate=0, it reliably destroys the snapback i.e. with capturerate=90, white is much more likely to come back to the situation later even when playing tenuki first.]PC[The KGS Go Server at http://www.gokgs.com/]C[pachi [-\]: GTP Engine for pachi (white): Pachi Distributed Engine version 6.99 (Chihaku-devel): I'm playing the distributed engine. When I'm losing, I will resign, if I think I win, I play until you pass. Anyone can send me 'winrate' in private chat to get my assessment of the position.
CzechBot [1k\]: GTP Engine for CzechBot (black): MoGo version MoGo version 4.86.Soissons: I'll resign if you win and playing until you pass if I win. If you passed and I did not, it often means that the status of some stones are not clear enough for me (I want to be sure we will agree on dead stones). Clarify them. Maybe I am losing, but have not enough time to be sure I should resign. In this case play until the end :'( (very rare cases)

chid0ri [?\]: i wonder why did it play that blunder
chid0ri [?\]: ^ pasky
jlg [?\]: there are two bugs: one which caused F9, another one is that it should have resigned earlier
chid0ri [?\]: do you have logs?
jlg [?\]: yes I will send you logs for this one
chid0ri [?\]: thx
jlg [?\]: but I don't keep everything, it's too verbose with 320 cores
chid0ri [?\]: :)
jlg [?\]: you might be able to reproduce the bug even on a single machine
jlg [?\]: it just didn't see the snapback
chid0ri [?\]: well i'm more curious about why didnt it resign right now
chid0ri [?\]: ah
jlg [?\]: the snapback issue seems more serious to me than not resigning...
