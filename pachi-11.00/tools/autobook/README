This is a shell-based UCT implementation. ;-)

From another perspective, this is a tool for automated opening book
construction. The book is based on UCT tree with large exploration
coefficient and fed with results from games against a compenent
opponent.

The UCT tree is stored in a directory tree, directories are nodes,
UCT statistics are stored in the 'stats' file of each directory
(first line is # of wins, second is # of playouts).  Start the book
building by running the

	autobook.sh PACHI_CMD OPPONENT_CMD BOOKDIR

script, specifying complete Pachi and opponent's invocation details
in the two parameters. If BOOKDIR exists, autobook.sh will continue
an existing opening book build; multiple autobook.sh scripts may
be running too. Just break it (Ctrl-C) when you want to stop.

These helper scripts are used by autobook.sh:

	walk.sh		A single iteration of the algorithm
	eval.sh		Choose next move to choose in the current directory (node)
	expand.sh	Create subdirectories (followup nodes) in the cwd

The built autobook can be converted to an opening book in the fbook
format (on the most-simulated basis) using:

	autobook2fbook.sh BOOKDIR
